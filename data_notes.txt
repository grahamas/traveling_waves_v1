Data Notes

- Data as described in Muller, Reynaud, Chavane, & Destexhe, "The stimulus-evoked population response in visual cortex of awake monkey is a propagating wave," 2014.
- rows x columns x time_points x trials
- 110 Hz time sampling
	- From this, we deduce 600ms trials
	- From this and the paper methods, we deduce: 100ms delay, 100ms stimulus, 400 ms blank.
- 56.6um pixel separation
